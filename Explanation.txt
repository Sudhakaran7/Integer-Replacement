You are given with a number n, you have to say in how many steps it can be replaced to 1 with following operations,
If n is even, replace n with n/2.
If n is odd, you can replace n with either n + 1 or n - 1.
What is the minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1?

Input description:
n an integer (1<n<1000)

Output Description:
minimum number of replacements needed for n to become 1

Sample Input:
7

Sample Output:
4

Explanation:
n=7,
so first n=n+1, n=7+1=8
now 8/2 -> 4/2 -> 2/2 ->1
so four steps
